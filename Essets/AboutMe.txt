About Me
I'm Ilan Sastiel, a passionate multidisciplinary designer who loves creating meaningful, beautiful visuals.
My background includes digital painting, branding, logo design, and user interface mockups. I'm not just about the art – I’m also a thinker, a planner, and a storyteller.
My journey includes hands-on experience with everything from intuitive sketching to sleek landing pages and full campaign identity systems.
I strive to craft projects that are both functional and inspiring. I'm currently exploring how to combine my love for storytelling and interactivity in digital products.

This portfolio is a reflection of my dedication, creativity, and constant curiosity. Thanks for stopping by!
